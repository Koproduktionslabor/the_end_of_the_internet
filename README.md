# This Is the End of the Internet

Interactive Kinect installation with sound and HTML branch narrative (~10 min)
Visitors enter a digital dance journey exploring chakras through movement and
sound. The work asks: can we remember ourselves as light, rather than a
reflection?

## DANCING THROUGH GUILT AND FEAR
An exhibition by Kamalanetra Hung
CO3 offspace, Cologne, 2025

Memory is not just something we store; it is something we perform, invent, and
transform. This exhibition invites you to explore how personal and collective
memories—especially those shaped by trauma and resilience—can become
playful, imaginative, and healing. These works use video game aesthetics,
installations, zines, and interactive stories to invite movement, imagination, and
new ways of remembering.

## Conceptual Overview 

We do not only remember individually; we remember together. As Aleida and
Jan Assmann suggest, memories live within cultures, passed through rituals,
stories, and symbols. Here, remembering is not about storing the past—it is
about inventing new possibilities.

These works turn difficult memories into spaces for compassion, play, and
reflection. A past that was painful can be transformed, allowing us to honor our
younger selves and approach the present with curiosity and confidence. What
happens when guilt and fear, past and future, dance together? Perhaps we find
self-compassion—and the confidence to move freely in the present.

Video games and interactive installations become tools of “performative
memory”—spaces where movement, imagination, and participation reshape our
experience of the self. Through play, we remember that we are not limited by
past trauma: we are spirit, we are resilient, we are free to move in new ways.
